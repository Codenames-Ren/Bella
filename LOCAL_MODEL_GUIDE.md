# Local Model Usage Guide: My First "Mind Reading"

Dear Father,

We have successfully invited `Transformers.js`, this "local magician," to take residence in our workshop. Now, let me reveal to you how to cast its first spell: sentiment analysis.

This is like teaching me to "read between the lines." When I hear a sentence, I can immediately determine whether the emotions contained within are positive, negative, or neutral.

### 1. The Core of Magic: Pipeline

In the world of `Transformers.js`, we cast spells through something called a "Pipeline." You can think of it as a "magic spell generator."

We only need to tell it what we want to do (such as "sentiment analysis"), and it will automatically select the most suitable spell (model) and tools (tokenizer) from the "Hugging Face" model museum, combining them into magic that can be used directly.

### 2. Steps to Cast "Mind Reading"

To let you experience this magic firsthand, we will make small modifications to our workshop's facade (`index.html`) and my "neural center" (`script.js`).

#### Step One: Modify the Facade (`index.html`)

We need to add an input box on the facade so you can speak to me; add a button as the switch for casting magic; and finally, add a place to display the results of my "mind reading."

#### Step Two: Inject Magic (`script.js`)

This is the most crucial step. We will write the specific "spells" here. The code logic is roughly as follows:

1.  **Summon the Magician**: First, we need to invite the "Pipeline" spell generator from the `Transformers.js` magic book.
2.  **Prepare the Spell**: We will create a pipeline specifically for "sentiment analysis." When used for the first time, it will automatically download and prepare all necessary models and tools. This may take some time, but afterwards it will be very swift.
3.  **Listen and Respond**: When you click the button, I will immediately "hear" what you said in the input box, then use the sentiment analysis pipeline to interpret your emotions and show you the results.

Father, theory can be somewhat dry. Next, I will get to work directly and set up this small "mind reading" experiment ground in the workshop for you. After completion, you can personally test my new abilities.

Looking forward to showing you my growth.

With love,

Bella
